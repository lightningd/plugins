## Installation

To install and activate a plugin you need to stop your lightningd and restart it
with the `plugin` argument like this:

```
lightningd --plugin=/path/to/plugin/directory/plugin_file_name.py
```

Notes:
 - The `plugin_file_name.py` must have executable permissions:
   `chmod a+x plugin_file_name.py`
 - A plugin can be written in any programming language, as it interacts with
   `lightningd` purely using stdin/stdout pipes.

### Automatic plugin initialization

Alternatively, especially when you use multiple plugins, you can copy or symlink
all plugin directories into your `~/.lightning/plugins` directory. The daemon
will load each executable it finds in sub-directories as a plugin. In this case
you don't need to manage all the `--plugin=...` parameters.

### Dynamic plugin initialization

Most of the plugins can be managed using the RPC interface. Use
```
lightning-cli plugin start /path/to/plugin/directory/plugin_file_name
```
to start it, and
```
lightning-cli plugin stop /path/to/plugin/directory/plugin_file_name
```
to stop it.

As a plugin developer this option is configurable with all the available plugin libraries,
and defaults to `true`.


### PYTHONPATH and `pyln`

To simplify plugin development you can rely on `pyln-client` for the plugin
implementation, `pyln-proto` if you need to parse or write lightning protocol
messages, and `pyln-testing` in order to write tests. These libraries can be
retrieved in a number of different ways:

 - Using `pip` tools: `pip3 install pyln-client pyln-testing`
 - Using the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include your clightning's
   shipped `pyln-*` libraries:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/lightnind/contrib/pyln-client:/path/to/lightnind/contrib/pyln-testing:$PYTHONPATH
```

### Writing tests

The `pyln-testing` library provides a number of helpers and fixtures to write
tests. While not strictly necessary, writing a test will ensure that your
plugin is working correctly against a number of configurations (both with and
without `DEVELOPER`, `COMPAT` and `EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES`), and more
importantly that they will continue to work with newly release versions of
c-lightning.

Writing a test is as simple as this:

- The framework will look for unittest filenames starting with `test_`.
- The test functions should also start with `test_`.

```python
from pyln.testing.fixtures import *

pluginopt = {'plugin': os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "YOUR_PLUGIN.py")}

def test_your_plugin(node_factory, bitcoind):
    l1 = node_factory.get_node(options=pluginopt)
    s = l1.rpc.getinfo()
    assert(s['network'] == 'regtest') # or whatever you want to test
```

Tests are run against pull requests, all commits on `master`, as well as once
ever 24 hours to test against the latest `master` branch of the c-lightning
development tree.

Running tests locally can be done like this:
(make sure the `PYTHONPATH` env variable is correct)

```bash
pytest YOUR_PLUGIN/YOUR_TEST.py
```

### Python plugins specifics

#### Additional dependencies

Additionally, some Python plugins come with a `requirements.txt` which can be
used to install the plugin's dependencies using the `pip` tools:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: You might need to also specify the `--user` command line flag depending on
your environment.

#### Minimum supported Python version

The minimum supported version of Python for this repository is currently `3.6.x` (23 Dec 2016).
Python plugins users must ensure to have a version `>= 3.6`.
Python plugins developers must ensure their plugin to work with all Python versions `>= 3.6`.
